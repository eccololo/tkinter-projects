In this Capstone Project from 100 Days of Code Challenge I focused on
building this app as fast as I could without looking much on code
quality. My goal was to measure how fast I can build it that is why
quality of this code is quite poor.

I achieved my goal after about 5h. I don't know if this time is good
or not but I am quite satisfied as an intermediate in programming.

Thanks.

Build time: +/- 5h
